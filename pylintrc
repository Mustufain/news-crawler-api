# I0011 - locally disabling ...
# If a pylint message is locally disabled - there is a reason for it. There is no need
# To show a warning

# C0203 - Metaclass method ... should have 'cls' as first argument
# pep8 says otherwise - lets stick with pep8 here

# R1705 - no-else-return] Unnecessary "else" after "return"
# Sometimes else at the end looks clearer, let's allow this.
